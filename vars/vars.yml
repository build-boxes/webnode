# Ansible Playbook Variables:
#     - Can include Role default variables that need to be overridden by this playbook.
#     - Secret Variables are saved 'secrets.yml' in seperate file and should not be
#       version controlled. Also they should be encrypted for safety using
#       ansible-vault.
#     - See ../docs sub-folder for help on how to use ansible-vault.
